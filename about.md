I'm one of the core developers of [PlasmaPy](https://www.plasmapy.org):
an open source core Python package for plasma research and education.
More generally, I advocate for [making diversity, equity, and inclusion
intrinsic to our community and our
work](https://engage.aps.org/dpp/programs/dei-organizing-collective);
making plasma science [more open and
reproducible](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4274274); and [improving the
quality of our research software](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3922956).

In addition to my work in [research software
engineering](https://us-rse.org/), my research interests include magnetic
reconnection (especially in partially ionized plasmas), the energetics of
coronal mass ejections, and puns about computational magnetohydrodynamics.
